# Coins-Historical-Time-Series

This project aims to use machine learning algorithms to predict the values of Dogecoin, Bitcoin, and Ethereum based on specific attributes. Such predictions would be valuable to investors considering investing, as they can use them to decide whether or not to invest efficiently.

The main focus of this project is understanding the factors that affect the value of Dogecoin. To this end, we will compare the values of Dogecoin, Bitcoin, and Ethereum to determine if there is any correlation between them. In addition, we will investigate Elon Musk's tweets' role in the value of Dogecoin. Specifically, we will analyze the changes in Dogecoin's value after Musk tweets about it using a classification tree method. As the dataset covers an extended period, we will also be able to examine how the effect of tweets changes over time through exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, and hypothesis testing.
